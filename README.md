## Project Title

Sidequest week 4

## Authors

Allison Kalist (original code taken from Dr. Karen Cochrane and David Han example)

## Description

This code was updated from week 4 - example 5 to change the platform, background, and blob colours; as well as adding two new platforms to make jumping more difficult, and a star shape to indicate that the player is supposed to navigate their way to it. Shapes were created using "classes" and called using JSON files.

## Setup and Interaction Instructions

- Use WASD or arrow keys to move around. Space bar to jump.
- Navigate your way to the gold star.
